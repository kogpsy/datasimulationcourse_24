Specifically, we will cover how to install R and RStudio, load packages, import data, data wrangling, and data visualization.

If you are proficient (i.e. regular use) in R and RStudio, you can skip this day as we will provide a general introduction only. The content of the introduction can be found [here](www.github.com/kogpsy/datasimulationcourse_24/introduction.html). The script for day 1 will be also available on this website.
