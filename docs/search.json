We will give a brief introduction to working with R and RStudio as well as an overview of the key functions for day 2 and 3. Specifically, we will cover how to install R and RStudio, load packages, import data, data wrangling, and data visualization.\nIf you are proficient (i.e. regular use) in R and RStudio, you can skip this day as we will provide a general introduction only. The content of the introduction can be found here. The script for day 1 will be also available on this website.\nSecond and third course day: Data simulation with Lisa deBruine\n1st and 2nd of February 2024\n09:00-17:00\nLunch break: 12:00-13:00 Lunch will not be provided (Mensa/ Cafeteria is open)\nRoom: B102, Fabrikstrasse 8, 3012 Bern\nDuring these two course days, Prof. Dr. Lisa deBruine will give a hands-on introduction to data simulation. It is best to bring your own data to work on during the workshop."
